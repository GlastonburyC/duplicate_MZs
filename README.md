duplicate_MZs
=============

Single MZ twins are often genotyped. However, duplication of genotypes for un-genotyped co-twin is usually required.

This python script takes a .sample file and a bimbam file (modify to .gen accordingly), a list of MZs that need duplicating and duplicates the co-twins genotype for all SNPs.
